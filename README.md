SolarizedSR
===========

A Solarized theme I used in Xcode 4. Light and Dark variant included, uses the exact RGB colors recommended by the Solarized project. 

If my eyes are feeling tired, switching between the light and dark variant of this theme often helps.

I downloaded and modified the themes built by robgrant at some point in the past and am just now uploading them. https://github.com/robgrant/xcode-colors-solarized

Note: the parameter types don't show up colored in the screenshots; switching between themes in Xcode sometimes causes issues with highlighting in open files.
